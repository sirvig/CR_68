                <h1>Dream with us...</h1>
                <p>
                    Everything that 6:8 Ministries is able to do in Costa Rica is funded by mission teams and donations.  
                    Over the last 10 years we have been able to share the Gospel message with and show the love of Christ to thousands of local people, 
                    as well as disciple the mission teams and send them back to the hardest mission field in the world.  As we move into the next exciting phase of actually providing 
                    safe and loving homes to some of these beautiful children, we need to take our fund raising to the next level.  In order to complete 
                    the first family house we need to quickly raise $42,000.  This will pay for much of what was already purchased and built and also fund 
                    the remaining materials.  If you are able to help us please click on one of the donation boxes and you will be brought to the paypal 
                    link for our ministry.  Your gift will be tax-deductible and 100% of it will be used for the construction and furnishing of this first home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are hoping 68 families will join us in donating at the various levels below.  Together we can build a place of hope and healing for the children
                    of Costa Rica.
